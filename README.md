# Follow me here: My own personal link tree.

I figured instead of using the generic link websites, I would make my own personal one.

## How It's Made:

HTML / CSS

## Optimizations

I will slowly work on making this more fine tuned as I develop it and master my crafts.

## Lessons Learned:

Allows me to work on solving common CSS & HTML issues that might come up from not using it everyday.
